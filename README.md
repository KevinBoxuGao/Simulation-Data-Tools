# Ansys Simulation Data Transformation Automation Tools
A set of tools used to optimize tasks in Ansys related to computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis simulations using C++ and Boost. Was commissioned by my father in his work as a mechanical engineer.
## coordinate matcher commission

Commission to my dad for his job. This program is used to find matching coordinates and identify them. It requires two input files that are in a specific format as seen in the input files.

The boost library is included in a zip via lib.

To run this all you need to do is compile it, then have this file structure
- coordinate_matcher.exe
- Input(Folder) sample inputs provided
- Output(Folder)

## temperature time adjustor
Second part of commission to my dad. Adjusts the temperatures of an output file to adjust for change in temperture.

The boost library is included in a zip via lib.
To run this all you need to do is compile it, then have this file structure
- temperatureFileAdjustor.exe
- Input(Folder) sample inputs provided
- Output(Folder)
